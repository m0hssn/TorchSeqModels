# TorchSeqModels

This repository, contains implementations of various sequence processing neural network models using PyTorch.

## Files

- `RNN.py`: Implementation of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) blocks and models for sequence data processing.
- `LSTM.py`: Includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks, capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequence data.
- `GRU.py`: Provides Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) blocks, a variant of RNNs with a unique gating mechanism.
- `Train.py`: Contains a generic training function applicable to any PyTorch-defined neural network model.

## Usage

To utilize these models, ensure PyTorch is installed. Instantiate and integrate the classes within a PyTorch training loop as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
